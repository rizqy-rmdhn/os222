## Week 00

1. [Playlist Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O)<br>
Neso Academy curates a helpful playlist to help me understand Operating System in general. Each video is relatively short, approximately 10-20 minutes, so it is easy to follow along.
The videos in the playlist also have medias and pictures to give the viewers a better understanding. 
However, the speaker in the video has a thick indian accent. Personally, it made it hard for me to follow. But, all in all, the playlist helped me a lot!!!

2. [Computer Basics: Understanding Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkGCLIQx1MI)<br>
A really good introduction video of OS. It caught my attention at the first sight! 
It is short, only 1 minute and 30 second, but they introduce me to OS so well in such a brief time.
It also has an animation, so you will enjoy it! 


3. [MIT 6.004 L19: Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj2hN_pFA8w)<br>
Okay, before you click on the link, let me tell you, it's long and it's a lecture video! Personally, I like to watch MOOC video to study on my own and this video has everything!
It is so resourceful. However, it is a long video, almost an hour. So, I would recommend putting the speed to 2x. But, this video is easy to understand! Give it a try! :D

## Week 01

1. [Virtual Machines explained in 15 Mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQP0wqNT_DI)<br>

Moreover, the video is accompanied with animation and colorful presentation, so you won't get boring watching it!

2. [Bash scripting cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash)<br>
This website gives you the easy way to learn Bash scripting! It gives you list of commands and syntax for Bash scripting. 
Contrastly, the examples listed on it do not come with the result, so it is kind of hard to imagine the answer!

3. [AWK FREE crash course](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/awk/)<br>
Though you need to create an account first to use its feature, but this website helped me learned all about awk! It is designed like SoloLearn or other programming language online courses!
So, it feels like a game and it made me learn it better!
